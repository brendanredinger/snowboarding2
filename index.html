<h2>The Arrival</h2>
<section>
<p>When you step out of the car for the first time of the season at the ski lodge the 
atmosphere is awesome. You have slight feelings of adreneline as you spread your eyes 
accross the vast hillside of splotches of pine trees contrasting with the pure white 
trails. A cold and brisk breeze brushes your cheeks with fresh and clean mountain air. 
The lodges, with their chimmneys spewing soft puffs of smoke, look tiny at the base of 
the massive mountain. I resist the urge to holler and yell with excitement to the quiet 
mountain.</p>
</section> 

<h2>The Slopes</h2>
<section>
<p>Nearing the top of the lift, the adreneline becomes worse, and the butterflies in 
my stomach go crazy making it is hard to sit still on the rather sketchy three person 
chair lift. As I slide down the quiet hill, a free feeling takes over and I float and 
soar like no other experience.</p>

<h2>The Hot Tub</h2>
<section>
<p>A lot consists in "a day snowboarding", and you can't forget a hot tub after eating 
dinner. When you are done snowboarding for the day you're wet, cold, and ache all over. 
The solution is a<em><b> hot tub</b></em>! It feels amazing and you sleep like a rock that night.

<h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>
<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare an it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperaturebefore you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."</p>
</blockquote>
